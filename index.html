    <div class="mission-title">Mission</div>
    <div class="missiontext">Having studied the piano for so long, I am eager to pass on the knowledge I have obtained to young, beginner piano students. Music has played a huge role in my life, instilling values such as dedication and passion within me. My goal is to help students find joy and entertainment through music, while consistently improving their skills.</div>

    <div class="lessons">Who should join?</div>
    <div class="lessontext"> Lessons are offered to beginner students, starting from age 4. If you have a child who has never touched a piano but expresses interest in music, or they fool around on the piano and are interested in building a solid foundation, don't hesitate to contact me! Basic theory, ear training and sight reading are also taught to fuel musical development. A consultation through Zoom will be conducted, as well as a trial lesson, for free, before moving on with lessons.</div>
